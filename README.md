# * Build a machine learning model**

In this activity, we will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.
<br/>

**The purpose** of this model is to find factors that drive user churn.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether or not a Waze user is retained or churned.
<br/>

**Part 1:** Ethical considerations
* Consider the ethical implications of the request

* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2:** Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

**Part 3:** Modeling

* Build the models, evaluate them, and prepare on next steps
